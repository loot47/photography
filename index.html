<h2 class = "title"> About Me: </h2>
<p> My name is Charlie Ciporin. I live in Greenwich, CT, and I am an amateur photographer.
I decided to take pictures one day out of mostly curiosity. So I got an old camera I found,
and went into my backyard taking pictures. I ended up liking it and getting slowly more
skilled. I hope you enjoy my pictures!</p>
